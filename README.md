# Healthcare_Smart_Contract_Complexity
Quantify the complexity of healthcare-related smart contracts. Develop models to predict execution time and gas costs. Explore verifiable computation protocols for off-chain computation.

# Environmental setup for Complexity Analysis


1. Development Environment Setup

	•	Blockchain Network: For the smart contract deployment and testing, you have been using a local blockchain network, like Hardhat. Make sure Hardhat is installed and set up correctly.
	•	Install Hardhat:

npm install --save-dev hardhat


	•	Set up a Hardhat project:

npx hardhat


	•	Solidity Compiler: Ensure that the Solidity version specified in your contracts is compatible with the Solidity version in the Hardhat environment.
	•	Check Solidity version in hardhat.config.js:

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.x",
};



2. Smart Contract Deployment and Testing

	•	Healthcare Contract: Ensure the contract is written in Solidity and deploy it using the local Hardhat network.
	•	Example deployment script in scripts/deploy.js:

async function main() {
  const Healthcare = await ethers.getContractFactory("Healthcare");
  const healthcare = await Healthcare.deploy();
  console.log("Healthcare contract deployed to:", healthcare.address);
}


	•	Run deployment:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost


	•	Test Framework: Use Mocha/Chai for testing.
	•	Install Mocha and Chai:

npm install --save-dev mocha chai


	•	Example test case for your smart contract (test/Lock.js):

const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Healthcare", function () {
  let healthcare;

  before(async function () {
    const Healthcare = await ethers.getContractFactory("Healthcare");
    healthcare = await Healthcare.deploy();
    await healthcare.deployed();
  });

  it("Should add a new patient", async function () {
    const addTx = await healthcare.addPatient("John Doe", 123);
    await addTx.wait();
    expect(await healthcare.getPatient(123)).to.equal("John Doe");
  });
});

4. Libraries and Tools

	•	Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed for running the Hardhat environment and interacting with smart contracts.
	•	Check Node.js version:

node --version


	•	Python Libraries: Ensure you have installed the necessary Python libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, etc.) for running the prediction step in Step 3.

5. Other Configurations

	•	Hardhat Configurations: Ensure the correct network and compiler settings are configured in hardhat.config.js.
	•	API or Model Integration: If you are using an external model or offloading computation (as you may in Step 4), ensure any external API or integration points are ready.

Recap of Completed Steps

	•	Step 1: Smart contract creation and deployment on a local blockchain (Hardhat).
	•	Step 2: Writing test cases for the contract and ensuring it behaves as expected (Mocha/Chai tests).
	•	Step 3: Implementing gas usage prediction using machine learning models (Python, scikit-learn).

This is the environmental setup until the completion of Step 3. If you encounter any issues in configuring or running specific components, feel free to ask for further clarification!
