# Introduction
As healthcare applications on the blockchain grow more complex, the associated smart contracts incur higher computational demands and gas costs. This project addresses these inefficiencies by building predictive models for gas consumption and exploring off-chain computation techniques to alleviate the computational load.
Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning to predict gas costs and execution times based on smart contract features and cryptocurrency market trends (Bitcoin and Ethereum).
Off-Chain Computation: Investigates zk-SNARKs and TrueBit protocols to reduce on-chain gas usage while maintaining privacy and verifiable results.
Healthcare Use Case: Focused on improving cost-efficiency for healthcare blockchain applications.



# Objectives
Quantify Smart Contract Complexity: Analyze execution times and gas costs for healthcare-related smart contracts.
Predict Gas Costs: Develop machine learning models to predict gas consumption based on contract features and market trends.
Off-Chain Computation: Explore verifiable computation protocols such as zk-SNARKs and TrueBit to reduce on-chain computational burden.

# Architecture
The system is divided into three modules:
Data Collection Module: Collects gas prices, cryptocurrency prices (BTC and ETH), and smart contract execution logs from the Ethereum testnet.
Modeling Module: Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict gas consumption.
Verifiable Computation Module: Offloads complex computations to off-chain environments using zk-SNARKs or TrueBit.

# System Design Overview:
Data: Includes gas price data from Owlracle API and crypto price data from CoinGecko API.
Model: Random Forest Regressor predicts gas costs based on contract features, ETH and BTC prices, and volatility indicators.
Verifiable Computation: Employs zk-SNARKs and TrueBit protocols to verify off-chain computations on-chain efficiently.

# Installation
# Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Ethereum node (Testnet or Mainnet)
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, OpenCV, Solidity, Ethereum clients (e.g., Ganache, Geth)

# Steps
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-smart-contract-complexity.git
cd healthcare-smart-contract-complexity
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Deploy Ethereum smart contracts (optional, for advanced users):
Deploy the Healthcare contract and other Solidity contracts to the testnet or use Ganache for local testing.

# Usage
Collect Gas and Price Data: Use the script to fetch gas and cryptocurrency prices:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/collect_data.py

# Train the Model: Train the Random Forest model to predict gas costs:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train.py
Run Inference: Use the trained model to predict gas consumption for a given smart contract:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/predict.py --contract contract_address --model trained_model.pt
Training the Model
The Random Forest Regressor is trained on historical gas price data, Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) prices. The dataset includes features such as:
Open, Close, High, Low: ETH price data
Price Difference: Difference between closing and opening prices
Time-based features: Hour and day of the week
You can adjust the following parameters when training:
epochs: Number of training epochs
batch-size: Batch size
train-test-split: Train-test split ratio
Command:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 32

# Results

Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 71,663,358.
Sample Predictions:
Actual Gas Price: 93,108.36, Predicted: 94,976.26
Actual Gas Price: 96,801.21, Predicted: 96,007.97

# Verifiable Computation Protocols
zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)
zk-SNARKs allow for off-chain computation while ensuring on-chain verifiability, maintaining privacy and reducing gas costs. These are particularly useful for healthcare applications, where data privacy is crucial.
TrueBit
TrueBit outsources computationally intensive tasks to off-chain solvers and provides a verification mechanism through challenge-response. This is beneficial for tasks like medical image processing and genomic analysis.

# Challenges and Future Directions
Proof Generation Overhead: zk-SNARKs reduce on-chain costs but require computational power to generate proofs.
Protocol Integration: Adoption of verifiable computation protocols in real-world healthcare systems requires addressing regulatory and privacy concerns.
